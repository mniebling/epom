  h2.title About Esther
  p
  | I am a full-time teaching artist at Alphonsus Academy and Center for the Arts,
  | where I strive to inspire a love of art and artmaking in children from ages
  | 3 to 14. I have been teaching art in the Archdiocese of Chicago for the past
  | twelve years, and completed a Master's degree in Art Education in 2013.

  p
  | While I love painting alone in my studio, I also love the challenge and the
  | excitement of teaching elementary school. It's a deeply fulfilling profession
  | and I've found that it has made me a better, more thoughtful artist.
